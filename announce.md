# Frictionless: Claude Code-connected apps

What if Claude Code could use apps with you collaboratively?

Like, you vibe-code or spec-code or just download an app and as you use it, Claude Code can interact with it too and even alter the app as it runs, without losing information and without needing a restart?

This is Frictionless. No difference between development and deployment.

Build Frictionless apps or download them. 
* Make dashboards for your Claude Code tasks: track progress, use levers and dials to drive from a UI
* Make prototypes: prototype production apps in a highly productive environment. Once it works, tell Claude to spec out a production app (hint, consider using [mini-spec](https://github.com/zot/mini-spec)).
* Improve your Claude Code life and your life beyond Claude Code with personalized expense apps, menu planning, or whatever other non-code, non-work things you do with Claude

Don't just collaborate with Claude to build apps.

Collaborate with Claude to use them.

*(btw, I'm saying "Claude Code" instead of "Claude" because Frictionless hooks up to Claude Code as an MCP server. It doesn't use the Anthropic API where you pay by the token—it uses your monthly plan.)*
