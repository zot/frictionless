# Frictionless — Company & Growth Plan

## The Thesis

Frictionless turns Claude Code from a text terminal into a **visual application platform**. This is transformational but temporary — Anthropic will eventually build native UI into Claude Code. The window is now.

Two win conditions:
1. **Anthropic notices, bundles it, hires me** — the ideal outcome
2. **User base grows large enough to sustain a business** — the fallback that also feeds #1

Both paths require the same thing: **maximum reach, fast**.

---

## What Makes This Special (The Pitch)

Frictionless isn't "another UI builder." It's the missing half of Claude Code:

- **Claude has full access to the running app** — sees state, calls functions, mutates data live
- **Apps poke Claude back** — bidirectional integration, not just one-way generation
- **Fully hot-loadable** — structural data changes without restart, rename a field and all instances update
- **Radically less code** — no API layer, no frontend JS, no sync wiring = fewer tokens = faster builds
- **Personal software ecosystem** — downloadable apps from GitHub, share and remix

**Elevator pitch candidates:**

1.  [ ] "What if Claude Code had a GUI? Not just for the code it writes — for everything. Expense tracking, job hunting, project dashboards. Chat to build. Click to use. Claude keeps running it."
2.  [ ] "On-demand GUIs for Claude Code. Describe what you want, click buttons, Claude does the rest."
3.  [ ] "Claude Code can now build apps you actually use. Not throwaway demos — real tools that stay running, stay hot-loadable, and talk back to Claude."
4.  [ ] "GUIs on tap. Tell Claude what you need, it builds a live app. No restart, no deploy, no frontend code."
5.  [ ] "The app layer Claude Code is missing. Chat to build. Click to use. Claude never leaves the loop."
6.  [ ] "Frictionless turns Claude into a full-stack app platform. You describe it, Claude builds it, you use it — and Claude keeps running it live."
7.  [ ] "What if every tedious workflow had a GUI and Claude was behind every button?"
8.  [ ] "Apps where Claude isn't just the builder — it's part of the app. Your buttons call Claude. Claude updates your state. The line between tool and AI disappears."
9.  [ ] "On-demand GUIs with Claude baked in. Click a button, Claude acts. Paste a URL, Claude scrapes it. The AI isn't behind the scenes — it's in the loop."
10. [ ] "Claude-integrated apps, built by chatting. Every app has Claude wired into it — not as a separate step, but as a living part of how the app works."
11. [ ] "GUIs on tap, Claude on call. Describe an app, use it immediately, and Claude stays embedded — handling the parts that need intelligence."
12. [ ] "What if your apps had Claude built in? Not as a chatbot bolted on, but as the engine behind every smart action. That's Frictionless."
13. [ ] "Claude is the ghost in your machine. Build apps by chatting. Use them by clicking. Claude haunts every button, every action, every smart decision."
14. [ ] "GUIs on tap. Claude is the ghost in the machine — it builds the app, runs inside it, and responds when you click."
15. [ ] "On-demand apps with a ghost in the machine. You describe it, Claude builds it, and then Claude stays inside — making every button smart."
16. [ ] "GUIs on tap. Claude is the ghost in the machine — it builds the app, lives inside it, and reshapes it on demand while it keeps running."
17. [ ] "GUIs on tap. Claude is the ghost in the machine — it builds the app, lives inside it, and reshapes it on demand while it keeps running." / *For everything. Expense tracking, job hunting, project dashboards. Chat to build and enhance. Click to use.*
18. [ ] "Claude doesn't just build your app — it runs inside as part of it. On-demand GUIs where Claude handles the smart parts, reshapes things live, and never leaves the loop."
19. [ ] "Let Claude run inside the apps it builds as part of them. On-demand GUIs where Claude handles the smart parts, reshapes things live, and never leaves the loop."
20. [ ] "Claude doesn't just build your app and leave — it builds itself into it. On-demand GUIs where Claude is part of every smart action, and reshapes the app live while it keeps running."
21. [x] "Build Claude into your apps. On-demand GUIs where Claude handles app requests normal code can't, reshapes the app live, and never leaves the loop."

## Audience Segments

### Primary: Claude Code Power Users
- Already paying for Claude, already in the CLI daily
- Pain: Claude Code is powerful but text-only; complex workflows are clunky
- They'll try it because it's one command to install
- **Size:** Tens of thousands, growing fast

### Secondary: AI-Curious Developers
- Heard about Claude Code, haven't committed
- Frictionless could be the reason they start — "build apps by chatting"
- **Size:** Hundreds of thousands

### Tertiary: Anthropic Employees & Leadership
- Need to see: this solves a real UX gap in their product
- Need to feel: this person understands our platform deeply
- **Size:** Small but highest leverage

---

## Growth Strategy

### Phase 1: Ignition (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal:** Get 500+ GitHub stars and land on Anthropic's radar.

#### Hacker News Launch
- **Title angle:**
  - [ ] "Show HN: I gave Claude Code a GUI — now it builds and runs visual apps"
  - [ ] "Show HN: Frictionless — a personal software ecosystem where Claude is the runtime"
  - [x] "Show HN: A personal software ecosystem where Claude is literally the runtime"
- **Post timing:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-9 AM ET
- **Comment strategy:** Be in the thread immediately. Answer every question. Show the job tracker demo live. Be humble but confident.
- **Key narrative:** "Claude Code writes code. But what if it could also *use* code? Frictionless lets Claude build UIs, run them, and interact with them — live. Paste a job URL, Claude scrapes it, fills the form, finds the salary. All in a hot-loadable app that never restarts."

#### Reddit Blitz (same week)
- r/ClaudeAI (483K members) — primary audience, biggest reach, they get it immediately
- r/ClaudeCode (96K members) — smaller but every user is the exact target audience. Post to both.
- r/ChatGPTPro — show what Claude can do that ChatGPT can't
- r/programming — "no API, no frontend, no sync code" angle
- r/SideProject — the indie hacker angle
- r/MachineLearning — the technical architecture angle

#### Twitter/X Campaign
- **Demo video (60-90 sec):** Screen recording of building an app from scratch via chat, then using it. The job tracker URL-paste demo is gold.
- **Thread format:** "I built a personal software ecosystem for Claude Code. Here's what it can do: 🧵" with GIFs of each feature
- **Tag:** @AnthropicAI, @alexalbert__, @amanrsanger, @alexjc (Anthropic folks active on X)
- **Hashtags:** #ClaudeCode #AI #BuildInPublic

#### YouTube
- **Full demo (5-10 min):** Already have one. Make a shorter, punchier version.
- **Title:** 
  - [ ] "Claude Code Can Now Build and Run Visual Apps — Frictionless Demo"
  - [ ] "Claude Code Can Now Run Inside Visual Apps it Builds — Frictionless Demo"
  - [ ] "Claude Code Can Now Run Inside as Part of the Visual Apps it Builds — Frictionless Demo"
  - [x] "Claude Code Becoming Part of the Visual Apps it Builds"

### Phase 2: Momentum (Weeks 3-6)

**Goal:** 2,000+ stars, 500+ active users, Anthropic conversation started.

#### Content Machine
- **Blog post:** "How I Eliminated 80% of the Code Claude Writes" — the technical story of no-API, no-frontend, no-sync
- **Blog post:** "Building a Job Tracker in 5 Minutes with Claude" — practical tutorial
- **Blog post:** "The Architecture of a Claude-Native App Platform" — for the Anthropic audience (see [What the Architecture Demonstrates](#what-the-architecture-demonstrates))

#### Community Apps
- **App marketplace/gallery:** Encourage users to share apps via GitHub
- **Bounties:** "Build an app, get featured" — spotlight community apps weekly
- **Template apps:** Ship 5-10 useful starter apps (expense tracker, habit tracker, project board, API dashboard, git dashboard)

#### Direct Anthropic Outreach
- **Email to Developer Relations:** Share usage numbers, link to HN thread
- **Apply to Anthropic jobs:** Reference Frictionless as portfolio piece
- **Anthropic Discord/Community:** Be present, helpful, reference Frictionless where relevant
- **Claude Code GitHub issues:** File thoughtful issues/PRs that reference the integration

### Phase 3: Moat (Weeks 7-12)

**Goal:** Establish Frictionless as the de facto UI layer for Claude Code.

#### Personal Software Ecosystem Flywheel
- More apps → more users → more apps
- GitHub app directory with categories, ratings, install counts
- "One-click install" from the console makes sharing frictionless (pun intended)

#### Enterprise Angle
- Teams sharing internal tool apps via Git
- Dashboard apps that surface project metrics
- "Build a team dashboard by describing it to Claude"

#### Integration Depth
- Support for other AI coding tools (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot) — but Claude-first
- Plugin system for custom integrations
- API for programmatic app creation

- **Team features:** Shared app libraries, role-based access, collaborative editing
- **Premium apps:** Polished, maintained apps for specific workflows (CRM, project management, etc.)
- **Priority support:** Direct help building complex apps
- **Price:** $15-29/month — priced below the pain threshold for Claude Pro subscribers

### Enterprise
- Self-hosted deployment
- SSO/SAML
- Audit logging
- Custom themes and branding
- **Price:** Contact sales

---

## Anthropic Hire Strategy

### Make Myself Undeniable
- Frictionless demonstrates deep understanding of:
  - MCP protocol and architecture
  - Claude Code's extension model
  - What developers actually need from AI tools
  - How to build developer tools that feel right
- The codebase itself is the resume

### What the Architecture Demonstrates

The design choices behind Frictionless are counterintuitive enough that "just ask an AI to build this" won't get you here:

- **Backend-only state** — no frontend code at all, just HTML templates with declarative bindings
- **Implicit change tracking** — change-tracker + Lua mutation means the UI updates without any sync wiring
- **Prototype-based OOP with structural hotload** — rename a field on a prototype, all instances update live, no restart
- **No API layer** — backend data *is* the UI state, no serialization, no endpoints, no DTOs

These aren't the choices an AI makes when you say "build me a hot-loadable app framework." They're the result of deeply understanding what makes apps expensive to build and stripping all of it out. This is the kind of architectural thinking that's hard to hire for.

### Positioning
- "I built the thing you need to build next"
- Not "hire me to work on Claude Code" but "I already built the next feature of Claude Code"
- Reference: Frictionless solves the UI gap that's the #1 request in Claude Code feedback

### Networking Targets
- Alex Albert (Head of Claude Relations)
- Aman Sanger (Claude Code lead)
- Anyone on the Claude Code or developer tools team
- Anthropic DevRel

### Conversation Starters
- Share usage metrics when they're impressive
- Offer to demo live
- Propose an integration path — "here's how this could be native to Claude Code"

## Metrics to Track

| Metric              | Week 2        | Week 6   | Week 12 |
|---------------------|---------------|----------|---------|
| GitHub stars        | 500           | 2,000    | 5,000   |
| Installs (estimate) | 200           | 1,000    | 3,000   |
| Community apps      | 3             | 15       | 50      |
| HN front page       | Yes           | —        | —       |
| Anthropic contact   | Outreach sent | Response | Meeting |
| Twitter impressions | 50K           | 200K     | 500K    |

---

## Immediate Next Actions

1. **Record a killer demo video** — the job tracker URL-paste flow is the hook
2. **Write the HN post** — IN PROGRESS, draft at `phase-1/hn-post.md`. Architecture section fleshed out with change-tracker details, security scanning, privacy angle. Needs final polish pass.
3. **Ship 3 more starter apps** — show breadth (expense tracker, project board, habit tracker)
4. **Clean up README for virality** — GIFs > words. The first 10 seconds decide everything.
5. **Set up analytics** — install tracking, app usage, to have numbers for Anthropic
6. **Draft Anthropic outreach email** — have it ready to send after HN traction
7. **Create a landing page** — GitHub README is good but a proper site converts better

## Risks

| Risk                                   | Mitigation                                                    |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Anthropic builds native UI tomorrow    | Speed. Be so established they acquire rather than rebuild.    |
| Low adoption despite awareness         | More apps, better onboarding, tutorial content                |
| Claude Code changes break Frictionless | Stay tight with MCP spec, keep integration surface small      |
| Burnout from solo development          | Focus on highest-leverage activities, delegate community apps |
| Someone forks and out-executes         | Build community loyalty, stay the canonical source, move fast |

---

## The Clock

This window won't stay open forever. Anthropic is almost certainly thinking about UI for Claude Code. The question is whether they build from scratch or build on what already works.

Every week of adoption makes "bundle Frictionless" more attractive than "build from scratch." Every user is an argument. Every app is evidence.

Move fast. Ship loud. Make it obvious.

---

## Versioning This Document

This plan is tracked in a Fossil repo at `company.fossil` (project root). The working directory is `company/`.

```bash
# Check status
~/.claude/bin/fossil status

# Commit changes
~/.claude/bin/fossil commit -m "description of changes"

# View history
~/.claude/bin/fossil timeline

# Diff against last commit
~/.claude/bin/fossil diff

# Revert to a previous version
~/.claude/bin/fossil undo
```

**When to commit:** Adding new content is safe — you can accumulate additions without committing. Commit *before* you're about to change or rework existing content, so you have a clean snapshot to revert to if the edit goes sideways.

## Writing Guidelines

**No em-dash asides.** Phrases like "this is great — and here's why" are an AI writing fingerprint. Use periods, commas, or restructure the sentence instead. This applies to all public-facing artifacts (HN posts, Reddit, blog posts, emails). Internal notes are fine.
